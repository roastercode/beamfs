 * beamfs -- threshold alerting
 *
 * Author: Aurelien Desbrieres <aurelien@hackers.camp>
 *
 * Everything beamfs knows about its own health is already recorded:
 * dmesg carries each uncorrectable, the RS journal holds coordinates,
 * the error budget holds remaining margin. All of it has to be looked
 * at, and on an unattended system nobody looks.
 *
 * This notifies. A uevent on the filesystem's kobject when a threshold
 * is crossed, which udev, systemd or a bare daemon can act on. The
 * kernel says a line has been crossed and stops there; deciding what
 * that means -- page an operator, schedule a copy, ground the aircraft
 * -- is policy, and policy does not belong in a filesystem.
 *
 * Three thresholds, each answering a different question:
 *
 *   a block reached zero margin      is this volume about to lose data
 *   uncorrectables in an interval    is it losing data now
 *   blocks at zero margin            how much of it is at the edge
 *
 * Rate-limited per event class, because the failure mode this must not
 * have is a volume degrading fast enough to bury the operator in
 * notifications about it.
 *
 * No overlap with the report side: this signals that something
 * happened, raf-decode says what. A notification carrying its own
 * diagnosis would duplicate the decoder and drift from it.
