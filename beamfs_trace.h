 * at t=2158.33, and a writeback kworker writes 105019 into the same
 * slot at t=2183.22, with the trace showing 0-> both times. The block
 * held the first pointer; the second writer did not see it.
 *
 * @uptodate says whether the buffer came back already valid -- a
 * buffer that had to be read from the medium is one the cache had
 * dropped, and what comes back is whatever was last written out,
 * which need not be what the last writer put in memory.
 *
 * @slotval is what sits in the slot about to be written, so a read
 * that returns zero where a pointer was installed shows up here rather
 * than being inferred from two slot_store events.
