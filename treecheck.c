/*
 * beamfs tree checker -- catch a lost pointer where it is lost.
 *
 * generic/464 reports the damage through fsck, twenty seconds after the
 * fact, as a count of blocks the bitmap calls used and no inode
 * reaches. Working back from that count means reading a million trace
 * lines and guessing which of them mattered, which is how two weeks
 * went by with three patches that each measured worse than the code
 * they replaced.
 *
 * The way out of chasing an intermittent defect is to stop chasing it:
 * check the invariant at every write, and the first violation arrives
 * as a stack trace naming the task, the block and the slot, instead of
 * a number in a log.
 *
 * The invariant: a slot that holds a pointer keeps it until the block
 * it names is freed. Every store into an indirect block is recorded
 * here; every subsequent store to the same slot is checked against the
 * record. A store that finds zero where a live pointer was recorded is
 * the defect, and it is reported at that instant.
 *
 * Cost: one hash lookup and one 16-byte entry per live pointer. Off
 * unless CONFIG_BEAMFS_DEBUG_TREE, and the calls compile away entirely
 * when it is off.
