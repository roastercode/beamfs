 * beamfs - File operations for BEAMFS_DATA_PROTECTION_UNIVERSAL_INLINE (v2)

 * Per-block Reed-Solomon FEC on user data: each 4096-byte disk block
 * holds 16 RS(255,239) shortened subblocks (3824 user bytes + 256 parity
 * + 16 pad bytes).
 *
 * This file implements the data path for scheme=2 (UNIVERSAL_INLINE).
 * The legacy iomap-based path in file.c is preserved for scheme=5
 * (INODE_UNIVERSAL); the dispatch happens in inode.c / namei.c when
 * setting i_fop and a_ops based on sbi->s_scheme.
 *
 * Threat model: validates against RadFI v0.1.0+ (single-bit flip in
 * bio_vec page payload during submit_bio_noacct). MIL-STD-883 SEE
 * coverage: up to 128 bytes corruption per disk block (8 byte symbols
 * per subblock * 16 subblocks).

/*
 * Writeback: encode into bounce pages, gather the pages into bios.
 *
 * How ext2 and ext4 write a file back, functionally: the flusher hands
 * the filesystem one folio after another; the filesystem resolves
 * where each block goes, appends the folio's pages to the bio it is
 * building while the blocks stay contiguous, and submits that bio
 * when they stop being contiguous, when it is full, or at the end of
 * the pass. Nothing waits per block, dozens of writes are in flight at
 * once, the device sees requests of 128 KiB rather than 4, and a
 * folio's writeback ends from the completion of the bio that carried
 * it. A block is a page, so no block is ever half a folio's and half
 * another's, and nothing is read back to be rewritten.
 *
 * beamfs cannot hand the folio's own pages to the device: a block
 * carries 3824 bytes of payload interleaved with 272 bytes of
 * Reed-Solomon parity, so every block has to be encoded into a bounce
 * page first. And because 3824 is not 4096, every folio ends inside a
 * block that the next folio continues.
 *
 * What was here before did the encode through the block device's
 * buffer cache, one buffer_head per block, one bio per buffer_head,
 * and took the buffer lock for each: the block a folio ended in was
 * read back, decoded, merged, re-encoded and written, and then the
 * next folio did the same to the same block -- waiting first on the
 * lock, which the write in flight still held. Measured on 2026-09-22
 * under generic/074: 2 176 467 writes of one block, 1.12 ms each, one
 * in flight at a time, 4.8 MB/s, every boundary block written twice
 * and decoded once; ext2 on the same device ran the same test in 17
 * seconds against a budget beamfs could not fit in.
 *
 * Now the boundary block is not written until the folio that
 * continues it has arrived: its payload waits in wb->pend, the next
 * folio fills the rest, and the block is encoded once and queued
 * once. Encoded pages come from a pool, not the buffer cache, so no
 * buffer lock is held across anything that can sleep -- the rule the
 * batch of 2026-09 broke and generic/076 turned into a four-party
 * deadlock. Blocks contiguous on the medium go into one bio of up to
 * 32 pages, submitted when the run breaks, when it is full, or from
 * writeback_submit at the end of the pass. Each folio carries a
 * counter of the blocks that hold its bytes; the bio completion
 * decrements it and finishes the folio at zero, so a folio whose two
 * blocks travel in two bios is finished exactly once.
 *
 * The buffer cache still holds aliases of data blocks: the zero image
 * a fresh allocation writes through sb_getblk, the copy a read-modify-
 * write took through sb_bread, the copy read_folio_range consults
 * first. Before an encoded page is queued, any alias is brought to the
 * same bytes and made clean, under its lock, so a reader that finds it
 * reads what the device will hold, and the block device's own flusher
 * does not later write the stale zeros over the data.
